      Doors system.
      Mainly developed in C++.
      My doors use different parameters and curves to be completely unique from each other, 
      allowing designers to create doors with differente feelings for the player to interact with.
      These doors are able to know which entity are they beeing interacted with,
      they do so in order to have different behaviours depending on who opens/closes them.
      Controls:
      E to Open/Close doors.
